# All-snake-games-I-made
This repository includes all the snake games I have made. [easy to PURE-TERROR]

I try to make games and other projects for fun. This set includes all of my snake games I have created. These include the following:
Easy,
Normal,
Hard,
Expert,
NIGHTMARE, and
PURE TERROR!!

I don't mind for my fans to edit my files, but only for personal use.
I didn't make these games too intense, because I don't know a lot of Javascript. I plan on learning more javascript and making irresistable games.

I plan to make my own horror games, publish some of my music, and make a game similar to minecraft, but making it look like a totally different game.

I hope this set does well, and I plan on publishing more sets like this.

Sincerely, The MEC-CEO (Mikey's Entertainment Company -CEO)
